We value kindness, curiosity, and clear communication. Prefer smaller PRs and keep discussions public for shared context.

## Collaboration
- Ask for assignment before beginning work.
- Use descriptive PR titles with context.
- Attach screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.

## Commits
- Use **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Example: `feat(docs): add Community Roles page`

## Reviews
- Be responsive to feedback.
- Keep commits clean; rebase if needed.
